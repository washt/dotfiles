# GraphQL for VS Code

This Visual Studio Code extension provides syntax highlighting and code snippets for the GraphQL language. Files ending with `.gql` or `.graphql` will be automatically handled.

This is an early stage extension which misses a number of desirable features such as [ES6 template string support](https://github.com/apollostack/vscode-graphql/issues/1), [autocompletion and refactoring](https://github.com/apollostack/vscode-graphql/issues/2) capabilitites.
